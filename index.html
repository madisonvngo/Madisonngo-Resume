        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside, I am currently studying Sociology. Sociology is known as "the study of the development, structure, and functioning of human society. Why did I choose this field of knowledge to study? Well, while researching the different majors offered at the university, I discovered this field. Sociology can be found throughout our daily lives and holds a much larger impact in our world than most people may think. Along with our daily life, Sociology is important in the field of medicine, which will help in my ultimate goal towards becoming a physician. Medical Sociology is important as it helped emphasized the role of socioenvironmental factors in health and disease. Therefore, my professional goal is becoming a physician whom specializes in pediatrics.  Also, it explains how the social environment affects human health as it identifies aspects within society that will reduce or increase the health risks in populations. <br><br>

        Pediatrics deals with treating young patients of the ages beginning from newborn to 18 years of age. As a pediatrician, I would prevent, detect, and manage physical and behavioral issues that affect children. Since I was young, I have been motivated to pursue a career in medicine. Numerous role models such as uncles and aunts whom are physicians themselves were present in my life since an early age. However, although they were a part of the reason for my choice, the main reason was my younger sister. Unfortunately, my younger sister has always suffered from a condition known as “eczema” or “atopic dermatitis”. Eczema is an inflammatory condition that causes dry skin, itchy skin, rashes, scaly patches, blisters, and skin infections. My parents have taken my sister to numerous physicians to undergo various types of treatments and tests. Each of the tests has lead to no conclusion on the cause for her outbreaks. Additionally, each of the treatments would only temporarily heal her outbreaks instead of permanently. Seeing my sister in pain created my motivation to enter the medical field as I wished to help treat those in similar situations and alleviate their pain. In regard to the specialty or field I chose to pursue, I wish to treat the generation of the future in hopes of creating a healthier future, which I believe can happen with the treatment of children who represent the future in my mind. <br><br>

        Prior to attending medical school, hands-on experience and volunteer work is essential in order to become a well-rounded and respectful individual. Some volunteer work I have participated in included donating masks to numerous hospitals such as Kaiser and CHOC during the pandemic, engaging in a food drive in Southern California, creating wellness bags for anyone who is in need, and spending time with those who were not able to see family during the Christmas season at a retirement home in Southern California. Hands-on experience that I have include interning at a pharmacy for three months as I worked with a pharmacist and pharmacy technicians in gaining a better understanding of pharmacology and shadowing a physician who specializes internal medicine to understand the proper procedure in the treatment of patients.
